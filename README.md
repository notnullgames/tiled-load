# tiled-load

This lets you read [tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) in javascript. It can handle JSON files, with all the different encoding options (zlib, gzip, base64, etc.)

It's meant to work in browser or node. It just loads the data in a normalized & easy-to-read format, and you can do whatever you want with it.
